## Organization

* **Pick your species**
 * Fraxinus excelsior
 * Tilia cordata
 * Acer platanoides
 * Robinia pseudoacacia

* Pick presentation options
  * check the folder _literature/ _ and choose one of the four options

* You will collect data on the following traits on your chosen species
 * Stomatal conductance - to understand rate of water loss
 * Twig water potential - to understand water status and stess level in the plan
 * Gmin (desiccation behavior) - to understand the rate of water loss after stomatal closure
 * heat sensitivity of a species - to understand thermal sensitivity of the species
 * Turgor loss point - drought tolerance trait
